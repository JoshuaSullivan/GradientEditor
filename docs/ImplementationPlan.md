---

## Development Workflow

### Per-Feature Process
1. Create feature-specific TODO file in `/docs` folder (e.g., `TODO-ZoomPan.md`)
2. Break down feature into checklistable tasks
3. Check off tasks as completed
4. Update CHANGELOG.md when feature is complete
5. Update TechnicalDesign.md if scope changed
6. Delete TODO file when feature fully complete

### Git Workflow
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- All work on `main` branch (solo developer)
- Use feature-focused commits
- Keep commits atomic when possible

### Testing Workflow
- Write tests alongside feature development (not after)
- Run tests before each commit
- Ensure all tests pass before moving to next feature
- Update tests when APIs change

---

## Dependencies & Considerations

### Technical Dependencies
- Swift 6.2+
- iOS 18+, visionOS 2+, macOS 15+
- SwiftUI
- Swift Testing framework

### Design Dependencies
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 where applicable)

### Future Considerations (Post 1.0)
- Custom color picker if system picker proves inadequate
- Undo/redo functionality
- Gradient presets beyond current set
- Animation/interpolation mode options
- Radial/angular gradient support
- Export to image formats
- Gradient noise/dithering options
- Color space selection
- macOS/visionOS specific features

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Gesture coordination complexity**: Multiple gestures (drag stop, pan, zoom) need to work together smoothly
  - Mitigation: Prototype gesture system early, iterate on feel
- **Size class adaptation**: Layout must work across many screen configurations
  - Mitigation: Test early and often on different devices/orientations

### Medium Risk
- **Accessibility compliance**: Ensuring full accessibility with custom gestures
  - Mitigation: Test with real accessibility features enabled, consult HIG
- **Performance**: Real-time gradient rendering while dragging
  - Mitigation: Profile early, optimize rendering pipeline

### Low Risk
- **API design**: Risk of needing breaking changes post-1.0
  - Mitigation: Thorough API review, gather early feedback
- **Swift 6 concurrency**: Potential hidden concurrency issues
  - Mitigation: Enable strict concurrency checking, thorough testing

---

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

✅ All features from TechnicalDesign.md are implemented
✅ Full test coverage with Swift Testing
✅ Complete accessibility support
✅ Working example app
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Clean, well-structured public API
✅ Swift 6 strict concurrency compliant
✅ Performs smoothly on target devices
✅ Fully localizable (infrastructure in place)
✅ Ready for open-source release

---

## Notes

- This plan is a living document and should be updated as implementation progresses
- Discovery during implementation may reveal additional work or allow simplification
- User feedback (if seeking early testers) should be incorporated iteratively
- Phase order can be adjusted based on priorities or dependencies discovered
