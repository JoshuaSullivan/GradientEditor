# Phase 1: Core Architecture & Foundation

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**Started:** 2025-10-12
**Completed:** 2025-10-12

## 1.1 Architecture Review & Refinement

- [x] Review all view models for proper @Observable usage and thread safety
- [x] Ensure all models are properly marked as Sendable where appropriate
- [x] Review public API surface - ensure proper access control
- [x] Implement progressive disclosure pattern in API design
- [x] Add proper error types and handling mechanisms
- [x] Create completion/callback patterns for parent app integration

## 1.2 Localization Infrastructure

- [x] Create Localizable.xcstrings file for string catalog
- [x] Audit all user-facing strings in the codebase
- [x] Replace hardcoded strings with localized string keys
- [x] Create string key constants for type safety
- [x] Document localization approach for contributors

## 1.3 Accessibility Foundation

- [x] Define accessibility label constants
- [x] Create accessibility trait patterns
- [x] Define VoiceOver behavior for all interactive elements
- [x] Plan Dynamic Type support strategy

## Architectural Decisions Made

1. **@MainActor Isolation**: Chose explicit `@MainActor` annotations over global build settings for clarity in framework API
2. **Removed Equatable/Hashable**: View models don't need these conformances and they cause Swift 6 concurrency issues
3. **nonisolated(unsafe) for localization**: Used for immutable string constants that Swift can't verify as thread-safe automatically
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Public API exposes essential functionality, with optional completion handlers defaulting to nil
5. **Error Handling**: Created comprehensive error enum with LocalizedError conformance for user-friendly messages

## Deliverables

✅ Swift 6 strict concurrency compliant codebase
✅ Localization infrastructure in place
✅ Accessibility framework established
✅ Refined public API with clear documentation
✅ Completion callback patterns for parent app integration
✅ All builds succeed with no warnings or errors

## Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is solid. Next phase will focus on gradient preview enhancement with orientation awareness, zoom, and pan functionality.
