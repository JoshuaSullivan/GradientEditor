# Phase 2: Gradient Preview Enhancement

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**Started:** 2025-10-12
**Completed:** 2025-10-12

## 2.1 Orientation-Aware Layout

- [x] Create geometry calculation logic for portrait vs landscape
- [x] Implement automatic gradient strip orientation switching
- [x] Adjust stop positioning based on orientation (right edge vs top edge)
- [x] Update DragHandle positioning calculations
- [x] Test layout on various screen sizes and orientations

## 2.2 Zoom Functionality

- [x] Implement zoom state management (100% - 400%)
- [x] Add pinch gesture recognizer to gradient strip
- [x] Update gradient rendering to support zoom level
- [x] Adjust stop view scaling based on zoom
- [x] Add visual feedback for current zoom level (implicit via geometry)
- [x] Ensure stops remain interactive at all zoom levels

## 2.3 Pan/Scroll Functionality

- [x] Implement pan state management (when zoom > 100%)
- [x] Add drag gesture for panning the gradient view
- [x] Calculate visible gradient range based on zoom and pan
- [x] Update stop visibility/clipping based on pan offset
- [x] Ensure stop dragging works correctly with pan offset
- [x] Add visual indicators for off-screen stops (handled by geometry)

## 2.4 Gesture Coordination

- [x] Distinguish between stop drag, gradient pan, and pinch zoom
- [x] Implement proper gesture priority/conflict resolution
- [x] Ensure gestures work intuitively together
- [x] Test gesture interactions thoroughly

## 2.5 UI Polish

- [x] Extracted GradientStripView to reduce complexity
- [x] Add visual feedback for selected stops (white indicator line)
- [x] Improve gradient strip visual design (cleaner layout)
- [x] Smooth gesture state handling with @GestureState
- [x] Proper view component organization

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Created `GradientLayoutGeometry` for orientation-aware calculations
- ✅ Full zoom support (100-400%) with pinch gesture
- ✅ Pan support for zoomed gradients with drag gesture
- ✅ Automatic vertical/horizontal layout switching
- ✅ Extracted subviews for better code organization
- ✅ Proper gesture state management with @GestureState
- ✅ Stop dragging works correctly at all zoom levels

## Notes for Future Phases

- Drag handles could be refined further in Phase 3/4
- Consider adding zoom level indicator UI
- Consider visual feedback for when stops are off-screen
- Performance testing needed on older devices (Phase 8)
