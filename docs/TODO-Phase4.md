# Phase 4: Example App

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Started:** 2025-10-12
**Completed:** 2025-10-15

**Goal:** Create a functional example app for manual testing and demonstration

**Final State:**
- Xcode project created with all source files and local package dependency configured
- Renamed ColorScheme to GradientColorScheme to avoid SwiftUI naming conflict
- Fixed all gesture conflicts (zoom, pan, handle dragging)
- All 127 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Example app builds successfully for iOS simulator

## 4.1 App Target Setup ✅

- [x] Design example app structure following SPM best practices
  - Separate Xcode project in Examples/ folder
  - Local package dependency approach
- [x] Create Swift source files (SchemeListView, EditorView, App)
- [x] Organize files in Examples/GradientEditorExample/
- [x] Create README with setup instructions
- [x] Create Xcode project with local package dependency
- [x] Configure app metadata (Info.plist, icons, etc.)
- [x] Build and test app on simulator/device

## 4.2 Scheme List View ✅

- [x] Create main list view showing all presets
- [x] Display ColorScheme name and description
- [x] Show gradient preview thumbnail for each scheme
- [x] Make list items tappable
- [x] Add proper navigation structure

## 4.3 Editor Integration ✅

- [x] Launch GradientEditView when scheme is tapped
- [x] Handle completion callback (save edited gradient)
- [x] Handle error/cancel scenarios
- [x] Test full workflow on device

## 4.4 Example App Features ✅

- [x] Add ability to save custom gradients (implemented)
- [ ] Add ability to share gradients (export JSON) - future enhancement (deferred to post-1.0)
- [ ] Add ability to import gradients from JSON - future enhancement (deferred to post-1.0)
- [ ] Add basic settings or about screen - optional (deferred to post-1.0)

## 4.5 Testing & Validation ✅

- [x] Test comprehensive suite (127 tests - 100% passing)
- [x] Test all implemented features:
  - [x] Zoom/pan gestures (verified via tests)
  - [x] Stop editing (add, delete, duplicate, modify) (verified via tests)
  - [x] Position validation (verified via tests)
  - [x] Adaptive layout (compact vs regular width) (verified via tests)
  - [x] Color picker integration (verified via tests)
  - [x] Export/import functionality (verified via tests)
- [x] Build verification on simulator
- [x] Verify example app structure follows SPM best practices (separate Xcode project in Examples/)

## Notes

- **SPM Best Practice:** Example app should NOT be compiled by library consumers
- Consider using Examples/ folder with separate Xcode project
- Or use conditional compilation flags
- Document how to run the example app in README
- Use example app to validate all Phase 1-3 features work correctly in real integration
