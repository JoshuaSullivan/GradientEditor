# Phase 4: Example App

**Status:** Awaiting Testing
**Started:** 2025-10-12

**Goal:** Create a functional example app for manual testing and demonstration

**Current State:**
- Xcode project created with all source files and local package dependency configured
- Renamed ColorScheme to GradientColorScheme to avoid SwiftUI naming conflict
- File rename pending (ColorScheme.swift â†’ GradientColorScheme.swift)
- Ready for testing after file rename

## 4.1 App Target Setup

- [x] Design example app structure following SPM best practices
  - Separate Xcode project in Examples/ folder
  - Local package dependency approach
- [x] Create Swift source files (SchemeListView, EditorView, App)
- [x] Organize files in Examples/GradientEditorExample/
- [x] Create README with setup instructions
- [x] Create Xcode project with local package dependency
- [x] Configure app metadata (Info.plist, icons, etc.)
- [ ] Build and test app on simulator/device

## 4.2 Scheme List View

- [x] Create main list view showing all presets
- [x] Display ColorScheme name and description
- [x] Show gradient preview thumbnail for each scheme
- [x] Make list items tappable
- [x] Add proper navigation structure

## 4.3 Editor Integration

- [x] Launch GradientEditView when scheme is tapped
- [x] Handle completion callback (save edited gradient)
- [x] Handle error/cancel scenarios
- [ ] Test full workflow on device

## 4.4 Example App Features

- [x] Add ability to save custom gradients (implemented)
- [ ] Add ability to share gradients (export JSON) - future enhancement
- [ ] Add ability to import gradients from JSON - future enhancement
- [ ] Add basic settings or about screen - optional

## 4.5 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test on iPhone (various sizes)
- [ ] Test on iPad (all orientations and split views)
- [ ] Test all implemented features:
  - Zoom/pan gestures
  - Stop editing (add, delete, duplicate, modify)
  - Position validation
  - Adaptive layout (compact vs regular width)
  - Color picker integration
- [ ] Verify no compilation when used as dependency

## Notes

- **SPM Best Practice:** Example app should NOT be compiled by library consumers
- Consider using Examples/ folder with separate Xcode project
- Or use conditional compilation flags
- Document how to run the example app in README
- Use example app to validate all Phase 1-3 features work correctly in real integration
