### Phase 4: Example App - Gesture Refinement

**Gesture Conflict Resolution:**
- Fixed zoom transform to properly display gradient at all zoom levels
  - Gradient stops now transform based on visible range
  - Added color interpolation at visible range edges
  - Handles edge cases when stops are outside visible range
- Fixed pan gesture to update smoothly during drag
  - Added active state variables (`activeZoom`, `activePan`) for immediate visual feedback
  - Synchronized with view model's zoom/pan on gesture end
- Fixed handle dragging coordinate space issues
  - Added named "gradientStrip" coordinate space for accurate coordinate conversion
  - Stores current geometry to ensure consistent coordinate-to-position conversions
- Separated gesture hit areas to prevent conflicts
  - Moved pan and pinch gestures from entire ZStack to gradient Rectangle only
  - Drag handles no longer trigger pan gesture when touched
  - Eliminates gradient "slip" when dragging handles at high zoom levels
- Fixed landscape handle alignment with adjusted offsets for rotated handles
- Fixed blank screen on first gradient selection using item-based sheet presentation

**Model Updates:**
- Added `startColor` and `endColor` computed properties to `ColorStopType` for interpolation support

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/GradientStripView.swift` - Added zoom transform logic, separated gesture hit areas
- `Views/GradientEditView.swift` - Added active gesture state tracking, geometry management
- `Views/DragHandle.swift` - Adjusted offsets for landscape orientation
- `Models/ColorStopType.swift` - Added interpolation helper properties
- `Models/GradientLayoutGeometry.swift` - Added safety for division by zero
- `Examples/GradientEditorExample/SchemeListView.swift` - Fixed sheet presentation pattern

**Status:** Gesture system working flawlessly. Ready for comprehensive testing.

### Phase 3: Stop Editor Enhancement - COMPLETED ✅

**Duplicate Functionality:**
- Added duplicate button to ColorStopEditorView with localized text
- Implemented duplicate action in ColorStopEditorViewModel
- Added intelligent duplicate positioning logic in GradientEditViewModel
  - Places duplicate at midpoint between current stop and next stop
  - Handles edge cases (first stop, last stop, only stop)
- Automatically selects newly duplicated stop for editing
- Updated drag handle view models when stops are duplicated

**Adaptive Layout:**
- Implemented size class-based responsive layouts
- Compact width (iPhone portrait): Modal sheet presentation for editor
  - Uses `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])` for flexible sizing
  - Controls hidden during editing to avoid crowding
- Regular width (iPad, iPhone landscape): Side-by-side layout
  - Editor appears in 300pt panel on right side
  - Divider separates gradient preview and editor
  - Controls remain visible during editing
- Smooth transitions with `.animation(.easeInOut)` on layout changes
- Sheet state synchronized with `viewModel.isEditingStop`

**Position Entry Refinement:**
- Added automatic validation in ColorStopEditorViewModel
- Position values clamped to valid range [0.0, 1.0]
- Invalid input automatically corrected without disrupting user
- Number formatter shows 3 decimal places with consistent formatting
- Position updates reflected immediately in gradient preview

**Localization:**
- Added `editor_duplicate_button` string key
- Cleaned up unnecessary `nonisolated(unsafe)` annotations on String constants

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/ColorStopEditorView.swift` - Added duplicate button
- `ViewModels/ColorStopEditorViewModel.swift` - Added duplicate action and position validation
- `ViewModels/GradientEditViewModel.swift` - Implemented duplicateSelectedStop()
- `Views/GradientEditView.swift` - Implemented adaptive layout with size class detection
- `Localization/LocalizedStringKey+GradientEditor.swift` - Added duplicate button key
- `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` - Added duplicate button string

**Status:** All Phase 3 objectives complete. Ready for Phase 4 (Example App).

### Phase 2: Gradient Preview Enhancement - COMPLETED ✅

**Orientation-Aware Layout:**
- Created `GradientLayoutGeometry` helper for calculating layouts based on orientation
- Implemented automatic switching between vertical (portrait) and horizontal (landscape) layouts
- Gradient strip now adapts to screen aspect ratio automatically
- Stops positioned correctly on right edge (vertical) or top edge (horizontal)

**Zoom & Pan Functionality:**
- Implemented zoom state management (100% - 400%)
- Added pinch gesture for zooming with proper state tracking (@GestureState)
- Implemented pan state management for navigating zoomed gradients
- Added drag gesture for panning with minimum distance threshold
- Pan only enabled when zoomed beyond 100%
- Smooth gesture state handling with base values for continuous gestures

**View Refactoring:**
- Extracted `GradientStripView` to reduce complexity in `GradientEditView`
- Separated vertical and horizontal layout logic for clarity
- Improved code organization with clear MARK sections
- GradientEditView reduced from ~235 lines to ~188 lines

**Gesture Coordination:**
- Implemented proper gesture hierarchy (stop drag, gradient pan, pinch zoom)
- Used @GestureState for smooth gesture lifecycle management
- Added minimum drag distance to prevent accidental pans
- Stop dragging works correctly with zoom/pan transformations

**Files Added:**
- `Models/GradientLayoutGeometry.swift`
- `Views/GradientStripView.swift`

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/GradientEditView.swift` - Complete refactor for orientation/zoom/pan
- `ViewModels/GradientEditViewModel.swift` - Added zoom/pan state and methods

**Status:** All Phase 2 objectives complete. Ready for Phase 3.

### Phase 1: Core Architecture & Foundation - COMPLETED ✅

**Architecture & Concurrency:**
- Added explicit `@MainActor` isolation to all view models (GradientEditViewModel, ColorStopEditorViewModel, DragHandleViewModel)
- Removed Equatable/Hashable from view models (unnecessary and causes Swift 6 concurrency issues)
- Made all view model initializers public for framework API
- Verified Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance throughout codebase
- All models properly marked as Sendable where appropriate

**Completion Callbacks:**
- Created `GradientEditorResult` enum (saved/cancelled) for parent app integration
- Created `GradientEditorError` enum with LocalizedError conformance
- Added `onComplete` callback to GradientEditViewModel
- Implemented `saveGradient()` and `cancelEditing()` methods
- Designed pattern for framework consumers to receive editing results

**Localization Infrastructure:**
- Created `Localizable.xcstrings` string catalog with all user-facing strings
- Created `LocalizedStringKey` extension for type-safe SwiftUI localization
- Created `LocalizedString` enum for non-SwiftUI contexts
- Replaced all hardcoded strings in views and models
- Used `nonisolated(unsafe)` for immutable localized string constants (Swift 6 pattern)
- Updated Package.swift to process Resources folder
- Removed "contact support" text per project guidelines

**Accessibility Foundation:**
- Created `AccessibilityIdentifiers` for UI testing
- Created `AccessibilityLabels` for VoiceOver support
- Created `AccessibilityHints` for additional context
- Added comprehensive string catalog entries for all accessibility strings
- Established patterns for future accessibility implementation in views

**Files Added:**
- `Models/GradientEditorResult.swift`
- `Models/GradientEditorError.swift`
- `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
- `Localization/LocalizedStringKey+GradientEditor.swift`
- `Accessibility/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift`
- `Accessibility/AccessibilityLabels.swift`

**Status:** All Phase 1 objectives complete. Ready for Phase 2.

### Project Planning
- **Created comprehensive implementation plan** (ImplementationPlan.md)
  - Analyzed current state of the project
  - Identified gaps between current implementation and technical specifications
  - Organized work into 8 distinct phases:
    1. Core Architecture & Foundation
    2. Gradient Preview Enhancement
    3. Stop Editor Enhancement
    4. Example App (reordered for early manual testing)
    5. Accessibility Implementation
    6. Testing Infrastructure
    7. API Refinement & Documentation
    8. Polish & Release Preparation
  - Estimated total timeline: 25-32 working days
  - Established success criteria and risk assessment
  - Documented development workflow and best practices
